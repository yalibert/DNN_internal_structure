# DNN_internal_structure
This repository will contain the tools from Alibert and Venturini (A&A, accepted).

We provide 4 Jupyter notebooks, that can be used to predict the critical mass (for normal opacity or reduced one), and the envelope mass (also for two values of the opacity).

The input must be entered in files Mcrits.dat (for the critical mass) and Menve.dat (for the computation of the envelope mass). The format of these files is explained in the notebooks.
